## Introduction
This project is meant to serve as a studying tool for students who want to more efficiently retain large amounts of information. This program achieves this through a simple flashcard interface.
### Features
* Utilizes Tkinter to create an easy-to-use resizable GUI
* Allows user to create, edit and delete flashcards
* Flashcards of the same subject are placed into groups called "Flash Groups"
* Each flashcard can be marked by how well the user knows the material (Unknown, Semi-Known and Known)
* Implemented .JSON to save and read flashcards from files
